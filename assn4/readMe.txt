•	What knowledge do human beings have that is NOT captured by this language model and that therefore causes the model to generate nonsense. 
	Write down at least three facts that, if the computer could somehow know them, would allow it to generate more sensible language.
		1. Use of punctuation. If the computer could use punctuation to end sentences, it would improve readability and overall clarity.
		2. Knowledge of basic grammar. The outputted poems have many fragmented sentences that do not include a subject, verb, and/or object.
		3. How to connect sentences. Even if the outputted poem had fragments, they could still be connected by conjugations. (But, and, or, yet, etc.) 
•	Compare the different poems. If your experience is like mine, some will be more coherent than others. Speculate about why this is true.
		With the shorter samples, the program has less room for error. Each WordFreqInfo object has less possible followers, forcing the poem
		to look more like the original sample which made sense.
